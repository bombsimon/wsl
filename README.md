WSL is a linter that enforces a very **non scientific** vision of how to make
code more readable by enforcing empty lines at the right places.

I think too much code out there is to cuddly and a bit too warm for it's own
good, making it harder for other people to read and understand. The linter will
warn about newlines in and around blocks, in the beginning of files and other
places in the code.

**I know this linter is aggressive** and a lot of projects I've tested it on
have failed miserably. For this linter to be useful at all I want to be open to
new ideas, configurations and discussions! Also note that some of the warnings
might be bugs or unintentional false positives so I would love an
[issue](https://github.com/bombsimon/wsl/issues/new) to fix, discuss, change or
make something configurable!

## Installation

### By Go Get (Local Installation)
You can do that by using:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/bombsion/wsl/cmd/...
```

### By Golangci-Lint (CI automation)
`wsl` is already integrated with
[golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint). Please refer to
the instructions there.

<br/>

## Usage
How to use depends on how you install `wsl`.

### By Go Get (Local Installation)
The general command format for `wsl` is:

```bash
$ wsl [--no-test] [arguments] <file1> [files...]
$ wsl [--no-test] [arguments] </path/to/package/...>

# Example

$ wsl ./main.go
$ wsl --no-test ./main.go
$ wsl -allow-declaration ./main.go
$ wsl --no-test -allow-declaration ./main.go
$ wsl --no-test -allow-declaration ./myProject/...
```

The "..." wildcard is not used like other `go` commands but instead can only
be to a relative or absolute path.

By default, the linter will run on `./...` which means all go files in the
current path and all subsequent paths, including test files. To disable linting
test files, use `-n` or `--no-test`.

### By Golangci-Lint (CI automation)
The recommended command is:

```bash
$ golangci-lint --disable-all --enable wsl
```

For more information, please refer to
[golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint)'s documentation.

## Checklist

Below are the available checklist for any hit from `wsl`. If you do not see
any, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/bombsimon/wsl/issues/new).

> **Note**:  this linter doesn't take in consideration the issues that will be
> fixed with `go fmt -s` so ensure that the code is properly formatted before
> use.
