# Whitespace Linter Checklist (WSL)
This page describes checks supported by [wsl](https://github.com/bombsimon/wsl)
linter.

<br/><hr/>

### Anonymous Switch Statements Should Never Be Cuddled
Anonymous `switch` statements (mindless `switch`) should deserve its needed
attention that it does not need any assigned variables. Hence, it should not
cuddle with anything before it. One bad example is:

```go
func (c *TimingStruct, s *SwitchesStruct) {
	c.timeout = goodTimeout
	switch {
	case s.Switches["bad timeout"]:
		c.timeout = badTimeout
	case s.Switches["zero timeout"]:
		c.timeout = 0
	}

	fmt.Printf("timer set. Delivering in time.\n")
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Add an empty line before the `switch` statement:

```go
func (c *TimingStruct, s *SwitchesStruct) {
	c.timeout = goodTimeout

	switch {
	case s.Switches["bad timeout"]:
		c.timeout = badTimeout
	case s.Switches["zero timeout"]:
		c.timeout = 0
	}

	fmt.Printf("timer set. Delivering in time.\n")
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Append Only Allowed To Cuddle With Appended Value
`append` is only allowed to cuddle with the appended value. Otherwise, they
deserve some distance. A bad example here would be
`append with z cuddled with x assignment` and
`append with x cuddled with if block`:

```go
func example(y int) string {
	z := []byte{}
	x := []byte{}
	z = append(z, byte(y))

	if len(z) == 0 {
		fmt.Printf("this is bad x: %v\n", x)

		z = []byte{}
	}
	x = append(x, byte(y+1))
	x = append(x, byte(y+2))

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z:%v x:%v\n", z, x)
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Group them if available (`append` with `z`) and leave an empty line before them.
Otherwise, leave an empty space before the `append` statement (`append` with
`x`):

```go
func example(y int) string {
	x := []byte{}

	z := []byte{}
	z = append(z, byte(y))

	if len(z) == 0 {
		fmt.Printf("this is bad x: %v\n", x)

		z = []byte{}
	}

	x = append(x, byte(y+1))
	x = append(x, byte(y+2))

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z:%v x:%v\n", z, x)
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Assignments Should Only Be Cuddled With Other Assignments
Assignments should either be grouped together or have some space between whoever
else before it. One bad example is `x` and `z` in such case:

```go
func example(y int) {
	t := 2

	x := y + 1

	if x == 1 {
		x = 0
	}
	z := x + 2

	fmt.Printf("got z:%v t:%v\n", z, t)
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Group all assignments together when possible (`t` and `x`). Otherwise, leave
an empty line before the assignment (e.g. `z`).

```go
func example(y int) {
	t := 2
	x := y + 1

	if x == 1 {
		x = 0
	}

	z := x + 2

	fmt.Printf("got z: %v\n", z)
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Block Should Not End With A Whitespace (Or Comment)
Having an empty trailing whitespace is unnecessary and makes the block
definition looks never-ending long. You want to let reader know that the
code definitions end right after the last statement. Also, any trailing
comments should be on the top. One bad example:

```go
func example(y int) string {
	x := y + 1
	z := x + 2

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z: %v\n", z)
	// TODO: add mux function later.

}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Remove the unnecessary trailing whitespace line (after `return` statement).
Move the comment to the top.

```go
func example(y int) string {
	// TODO: add mux function later.
	x := y + 1
	z := x + 2

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z: %v\n", z)
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Block Should Not Start With A Whitespace
Having an empty leading whitespace is unnecessary and makes the block definition
looks disconnected and long. You want to let reader to know that the code
definitions start right after the block declaration. One bad example is:

```go
func example(y int) string {

	x := y + 1
	z := x + 2

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z: %v\n", z)
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Remove the unnecessary leading whitespace line (before `x` definition).

```go
func example(y int) string {
	x := y + 1
	z := x + 2

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z: %v\n", z)
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Branch Statements Should Not Be Cuddled If Block Has More Than Two Lines
Branch statements (`break`, `continue`, and `return`) should stand out clearly
when the block is having more than or equal to 2 lines. Hence, it deserves
some spacing. One bad example is:

```go
for i := range make([]int, 5) {
	if i > 2 {
		sendToOne(i)
		sendToSecond(i)
		continue
	}

	if statement == "is short" {
		sendToOne(i)
		break
	}
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Add an empty line before the branch statements (`continue`) contained within
a more than or equal to 2 lines code block:

```go
for i := range make([]int, 5) {
	if i > 2 {
		sendToOne(i)
		sendToSecond(i)

		continue
	}

	if statement == "is short" {
		sendToOne(i)
		break
	}
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Declarations Should Never Be Cuddled
`var` declarations, in opinion, should never be cuddled. Instead, multiple
`var` patterns is encouraged to use the grouped `var` format. One case study is:

```go
func example(eolType int) string {
	var eol string
	var i int

	if eolType < 0 {
		return ""
	}

	i = eolType
	switch i {
	case 2:
		eol = "\r"
	case 3:
		eol = "\r\n"
	case 1:
		fallthrough
	default:
		eol = "\n"
	}

	return eol
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Since this hit is opinionated, there are 3 ways to deal with it:

1) Use the grouped `var` pattern:

```go
func example(eolType int) string {
	var (
		eol = ""
		i = 0
	)

	if eolType < 0 {
		return ""
	}

	i = eolType
	switch i {
	case 2:
		eol = "\r"
	case 3:
		eol = "\r\n"
	case 1:
		fallthrough
	default:
		eol = "\n"
	}

	return eol
}
```

<br/>

2) Pass in the `wsl` `-allow-declarations` argument. Example:

```bash
$ wsl -allow-declarations <file> [files...]
```

<br/>

3) Add to false-positive exclusion list. However, it is preferbly to do step 2
instead because the argument offered by `wsl` is also offered in the CI linter
tool. Example, for `golangci-lint` configurations:

```bash
$ golangci-lint run \
	--disable-all \
	--enable wsl \
	--exclude "declarations should never be cuddled" \
	.
```

<br/><hr/>

### Defer Statements Should Only Be Cuddled With Expressions On Same Variable
`defer` statement should only cuddle with related expressions. Otherwise, it
deserves some distance from whatever it is. One bad example is:

```go
func example() int {
	t := "2"
	s := func(t string) {
		if t == "" {
			// handle close error
			fmt.Printf("got t: %v\n", t)
			return
		}
	}

	x := 4
	defer s(t)
	fmt.Printf("x is: %v\n", x)

	return 0
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment:
Add an empty line before `defer`:

```go
func example() int {
	t := "2"
	s := func(t string) {
		if t == "" {
			// handle close error
			fmt.Printf("got t: %v\n", t)
			return
		}
	}

	x := 4

	defer s(t)
	fmt.Printf("x is: %v\n", x)

	return 0
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Expressions Should Not Be Cuddled With Blocks
Code expressions should not be cuddled with a block (e.g. `if` or `switch`).
There must be some clarity between the block and the new expression itself.
One bad example is:

```go
t, err := b.processData(5, 12, 23, 12)
if err != nil {
	// handle error
	return
}
fmt.Println(t)
```

#### Recommended Amendment
An empty line between the expression and block.

```go
t, err := b.processData(5, 12, 23, 12)
if err != nil {
	// handle error
	return
}

fmt.Println(t)
```

<br/><hr/>

### Expressions Should Not Be Cuddled With Declarations Or Returns
Any expressions should not cuddle with any declarations (`var`) or `return`.
They deserve some space for clarity. One bad example is (`run()`):

```go
func example(eolType int) int {
	var i int
	run()

	i = eolType + 5

	fmt.Printf("Hello by %v times in one pack\n", i)

	run()
	return i
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Give an empty after the declaration (`var`) and an empty line before the
`return`:

```go
func example(eolType int) int {
	var i int

	run()

	i = eolType + 5

	fmt.Printf("Hello by %v times in one pack\n", i)
	run()

	return i
}
```


<br/><hr/>

### For Statement Without Condition Should Never Be Cuddled
`for` loop without conditions (infinity loop) should deserves its own
attention. Hence, it should not be cuddled with anyone.


```go
func example3(y int) {
	if y == 0 {
		y = 15
	}
	for {
		fmt.Printf("count %v\n", y)
		y--
	}
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Add an empty line before the `for` loop.

```go
func example3(y int) {
	if y == 0 {
		y = 15
	}

	for {
		fmt.Printf("count %v\n", y)
		y--
	}
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### For Statements Should Only Be Cuddled With Assignments Used In The Iteration
`for` statement should only cuddle with related assignments. Otherwise, its
relationship status can be very complicated, making reader wondering what the
co-relation between the `for` block and whatever it is. One bad example is:

```go
func example(y int) int {
	x := y + 2
	for i := 0; i < y+10; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("this is i:%v\n", i)
	}

	return i
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Add an empty line before the `for` statement:

```go
func example(y int) int {
	x := y + 2

	for i := 0; i < y+10; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("this is i:%v\n", i)
	}

	return i
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Go Statements Can Only Invoke Functions Assigned On Line Above
`go` statement deserves clarity from any nearby non-related executions. Hence,
it deserves an empty line separation before it.

```go
func Example() {
	name := "Josh"
	go func() {
		fmt.Printf("Hello World\n")
	}()

	fmt.Printf("Job run by: %v\n", name)
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Add an empty before `go` statement.

```go
func Example() {
	name := "Josh"

	go func() {
		fmt.Printf("Hello World\n")
	}()

	fmt.Printf("Job run by: %v\n", name)
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### If Statements Should Only Be Cuddled With Assignments
`if` statement should only cuddle with one related assignment. Otherwise, it
should have a distance between `if` and whoever else is.

```go
func (c *Chain) Intercept(label int) {
	exist := c.CMDExist(label)
	c.sync.Lock()
	defer c.sync.Unlock()
	if exist {
		c.next = label
	} else {
		c.err = fmt.Errorf("some error message")
	}
}

func Example(a int) {
	exist := a < 10
	i := 10
	if exist {
		fmt.Printf("yes the thing exists.")
	}
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Group that single related assignment together with the `if` block and give one
empty line before them.

If environment is not allowed like mutex lock blocking
(e.g. `Intercept(...)`), add an empty line before the `if` block.

```go
func (c *Chain) Intercept(label int) {
	exist := c.CMDExist(label)
	c.sync.Lock()
	defer c.sync.Unlock()

	if exist {
		c.next = label
	} else {
		c.err = fmt.Errorf("some error message")
	}
}

func Example(a int) {
	i := 10

	exist := a < 10
	if exist {
		fmt.Printf("yes the thing exists.")
	}
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### If Statements Should Only Be Cuddled With Assignments Used In The If Statement Itself
`if` statements should only cuddle with the associated assignment. Otherwise,
it deserves some space between itself and whoever before it. One bad example is
the `if` block that uses `x` cuddled with `z` assignment:

```go
func example(y int) string {
	x := y + 1

	z := x + 2
	if x != 0 {
		fmt.Printf("bad x\n")
	}

	if y != 0 {
		fmt.Printf("what's going on? %v\n", y)
	}

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z: %v\n", z)
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Shift the `if` block close to the assignment when possible (`if` with `x`).
Otherwise, leave an empty line before it (`if` uses `y`):

```go
func example(y int) string {
	x := y + 1
	if x != 0 {
		fmt.Printf("bad x\n")
	}

	z := x + 2

	if y != 0 {
		fmt.Printf("what's going on? %v\n", y)
	}

	return fmt.Sprintf("got z: %v\n", z)
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Only Cuddled Expressions If Assigning Variable Or Using From Line Above
When an assignment is cuddling with an unrelated expression, they create
confusing relationship to one another. Therefore, they should keep their
distance. One bad example (all `fmt` printouts):

```go
func example(eolType int) string {
	var eol string

	switch eolType {
	case 2:
		eol = "\r"
		fmt.Printf("It's a return caret!\n")
	case 3:
		eol = "\r\n"
		fmt.Printf("It's a return and newline caret!\n")
	case 1:
		fallthrough
	default:
		eol = "\n"
		fmt.Printf("It's a newline caret!\n")
	}

	return eol
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Provide an empty line before the expression:

```go
func example(eolType int) string {
	var eol string

	switch eolType {
	case 2:
		eol = "\r"

		fmt.Printf("It's a return caret!\n")
	case 3:
		eol = "\r\n"

		fmt.Printf("It's a return and newline caret!\n")
	case 1:
		fallthrough
	default:
		eol = "\n"

		fmt.Printf("It's a newline caret!\n")
	}

	return eol
```

<br/><hr/>

### Only One Cuddle Assignment Allowed Before Defer Statement
`defer` statement should only be cuddled with 1 related assignment. If you have
more than 1 assignment(s), they should have a space between them for clarity
purposes. One bad example is (`defer s(t)`):

```go
func example() int {
	var t string

	f1, err := os.Open("/path/to/f1.txt")
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
		return -1
	}
	defer f1.Close()

	f2, err := os.Open("/path/to/f2.txt")
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
		return -1
	}

	t = "2"
	s := func(t string) {
		err := f2.Close()
		if err != nil {
			// handle close error
			fmt.Printf("got t: %v\n", t)
			return
		}
	}
	defer s(t)

	return compare(f1, f2)
}
```

> **EXCEPTION**: It is allowed to use the following:
>
> 1) The `defer` after `error` check as reported in [Issue #31](https://github.com/bombsimon/wsl/issues/31)
>
> ```go
> f1, err := os.Open("/path/to/f1.txt")
> if err != nil {
>	// handle error
>	return -1
> }
> defer f1.Close()
> ```
>
> OR
>
> 2) The conventional mutex `Lock` and `Unlock`.
>
> ```go
> m.Lock()
> defer m.Unlock()
> ```


#### Recommended Amendment
Add an empty line before `defer` (`defer s(t)`):

```go
func example() int {
	var t string

	f1, err := os.Open("/path/to/f1.txt")
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
		return -1
	}
	defer f1.Close()

	f2, err := os.Open("/path/to/f2.txt")
	if err != nil {
		// handle error
		return -1
	}

	t = "2"
	s := func(t string) {
		err := f2.Close()
		if err != nil {
			// handle close error
			fmt.Printf("got t: %v\n", t)
			return
		}
	}

	defer s(t)

	return compare(f1, f2)
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Only One Cuddle Assignment Allowed Before For Statement
`for` block should only be cuddled with 1 related assignment. If you have more
than 1 assignment(s), they should have a space between them for clarity
purposes. One bad example is:

```go
func example(eolType int) {
	i := 0
	a := 0
	for i = 0; i < eolType; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%v) Hello world by %v times!\n", i, a)
	}
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
An empty line between the last assignment and the `for` block.

```go
func example(eolType int) {
	i := 0
	a := 0

	for i = 0; i < eolType; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%v) Hello world by %v times!\n", i, a)
	}
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Only One Cuddle Assignment Allowed Before Go Statement
`go` block should only be cuddled with 1 related assignment. If you have more
than 1 assignment(s), they should have a space between them for clarity
purposes. One bad example is:

```go
func Example() {
	name := "Josh"
	s := func() {
		fmt.Printf("Hello World %v\n", name)
	}
	go s()
	fmt.Printf("Job run by: %v\n", name)
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
An empty line between the last assignment and the `go` block.

```go
func Example() {
	name := "Josh"
	s := func() {
		fmt.Printf("Hello World %v\n", name)
	}

	go s()
	fmt.Printf("Job run by: %v\n", name)
}
```


<br/><hr/>

### Only One Cuddle Assignment Allowed Before If Statement
If block should only be cuddled with 1 related assignment. If you have more
than 1 assignment(s), they should have more space between them for clarity
purposes. One bad example is:

```go
la := len(*a)
lb := len(*b)
if la != lb {
	fmt.Printf("subject A and B has incorrect length: %v|%v \n",
		la,
		lb,
	)

        return 3
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
An empty line between the last assignment and the `if` block.

```go
la := len(*a)
lb := len(*b)

if la != lb {
	fmt.Printf("subject A and B has incorrect length: %v|%v \n",
		la,
		lb,
	)

        return 3
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Only One Cuddle Assignment Allowed Before Range Statement
`range` block should only be cuddled with 1 related assignment. If you have more
than 1 assignment(s), they should have more space between them for clarity
purposes. One bad example is:

```go
func example(y []int) []string {
	r := 5
	t := []string{}
	for _, v := range y {
		t = append(t, fmt.Sprintf("%v: got %v\n", r, v))
	}

	return t
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Give an empty line before `range` statement:

```go
func example(y []int) []string {
	r := 5
	t := []string{}

	for _, v := range y {
		t = append(t, fmt.Sprintf("%v: got %v\n", r, v))
	}

	return t
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Only One Cuddle Assignment Allowed Before Switch Statement
`switch` block should only be cuddled with 1 related assignment. If you have
more than 1 assignment(s), they should have more space between them for clarity
purposes. One bad example is:

```go
func (c *Chain) Run(x func(super *Chain)) *Chain {
	c.sync.Lock()
	defer c.sync.Unlock()
	switch {
	case c.stop:
	case c.err != nil:
		go c.handleError()
	case len(c.interrupts) != 0:
		go c.handleInterrupts(x)
	case c.next != notIntercepted:
		go c.handleNext(x)
	case x != nil:
		go x(c)
	}

	return c
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
An empty line between the last assignment and the `switch` block:

```go
func (c *Chain) Run(x func(super *Chain)) *Chain {
	c.sync.Lock()
	defer c.sync.Unlock()

	switch {
	case c.stop:
	case c.err != nil:
		go c.handleError()
	case len(c.interrupts) != 0:
		go c.handleInterrupts(x)
	case c.next != notIntercepted:
		go c.handleNext(x)
	case x != nil:
		go x(c)
	}

	return c
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Only One Cuddle Assignment Allowed Before Type Switch Statement
`type` `switch` block should only be cuddled with 1 related assignment. If you
have more than 1 assignment(s), they should have more space between them for
clarity purposes. One bad example is:

```go
func example(y interface{}) int {
	n := 0
	z := 5
	switch x := y.(type) {
	case int:
		n = x + z
	case int8:
		n = int(x) + z
	case int16:
		n = int(x) + z
	case int32:
		n = int(x) + z
	case int64:
		n = int(x) + z
	}

	fmt.Printf("z is %v\n", z)

	return n
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
An empty line between the last assignment and the `switch` block.

```go
func example(y interface{}) int {
	n := 0
	z := 5

	switch x := y.(type) {
	case int:
		n = x + z
	case int8:
		n = int(x) + z
	case int16:
		n = int(x) + z
	case int32:
		n = int(x) + z
	case int64:
		n = int(x) + z
	}

	fmt.Printf("z is %v\n", z)

	return n
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Ranges Should Only Be Cuddled With Assignments Used In The Iteration
`range` statements should only cuddle with assignments related to it. Otherwise,
it creates unrelated relationship perception that sends the reader to wonder
why are they closely together. One bad example is:

```go
func example(y []int) []string {
	r := 15
	t := []string{}

	x := 5
	for _, v := range y {
		t = append(t, fmt.Sprintf("%v: got %v\n", r, v))
	}


	fmt.Printf("This is x %v.\n", x)
	for _, v := range y {
		t = append(t, fmt.Sprintf("%v: got %v\n", r, v))
	}

	return t
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Either group the related assignment together with the `range` block and
add an empty line before them (first `range`) OR an empty line before the
`range` block (second `range`):

```go
func example(y []int) []string {
	r := 15
	x := 5

	t := []string{}
	for _, v := range y {
		t = append(t, fmt.Sprintf("%v: got %v\n", r, v))
	}

	fmt.Printf("This is x %v.\n", x)

	for _, v := range y {
		t = append(t, fmt.Sprintf("%v: got %v\n", r, v))
	}

	return t
}
```

<br/><hr/>

### Return Statements Should Not Be Cuddled If Block Has More Than Two Lines
`return` statement should not be cuddled if the function block is not a
2-lines block. Otherwise, there should be a clarity with `return` line. If
the function block is single/double lines, the `return` statement can be
cuddled.


```go
func Generate(x int) (s string) {
	switch x {
	case 1:
		s = "one"
	case 2:
		s = "two"
	case 3:
		s = "three"
	}
	return s
}

func Sign(y *int) string {
	*y += 15

	return fmt.Sprintf("Hello world by %v\n", y)
}

func Check(z int) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Checking in by %v\n", x)
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
An empty line between `return` and multi-line block or no empty line between
`return` and single-line block.

```go
func Generate(x int) (s string) {
	switch x {
	case 1:
		s = "one"
	case 2:
		s = "two"
	case 3:
		s = "three"
	}

	return s
}

func Sign(y *int) string {
	*y += 15
	return fmt.Sprintf("Hello world by %v\n", y)
}

func Check(z int) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("Checking in by %v\n", x)
}
```

### Stmt Type Not Implemented
Congratulations! You had found an unforseenable future detection. This hit
simply means the detection is not implemented.

### Switch Statements Should Only Be Cuddled With Variables Switched
`switch` statements with associated switching variable should not cuddle with
non-associated switching entity. This will set the reader wondering why are
they grouped together at the first place. One bad example is:

```go
func example(eolType int) string {
	eol := ""
	switch eolType {
	case 2:
		eol = "\r"
	case 3:
		eol = "\r\n"
	case 1:
		fallthrough
	default:
		eol = "\n"
	}

	return eol
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Group related assignment together and add an empty line before them OR add an
empty line before the `switch`:

```go
func example(eolType int) string {
	eol := ""

	switch eolType {
	case 2:
		eol = "\r"
	case 3:
		eol = "\r\n"
	case 1:
		fallthrough
	default:
		eol = "\n"
	}

	return eol
}
```

### Type Switch Statements Should Only Be Cuddled With Variables Switched
`type` `switch` statements should only cuddle with its switching variable.
Otherwise, it makes unclear relationship between the `switch` block and whatever
before it. Here is a bad example:

```go
func example(y interface{}) int {
	n := 0

	z := 5
	switch x := y.(type) {
	case int:
		n += x
	case int8:
		n += int(x)
	case int16:
		n += int(x)
	case int32:
		n += int(x)
	case int64:
		n += int(x)
	}

	fmt.Printf("z is %v\n", z)

	return n
}
```

#### Recommended Amendment
Give an empty line before the `switch` statement:

```go
func example(y interface{}) int {
	n := 0
	z := 5

	switch x := y.(type) {
	case int:
		n += x
	case int8:
		n += int(x)
	case int16:
		n += int(x)
	case int32:
		n += int(x)
	case int64:
		n += int(x)
	}

	fmt.Printf("z is %v\n", z)

	return n
}
```
